## Data Systems Project code
This code runs the ING annotation tool developed for the Data Systems Project in 2019.  
  
In order to setup the code: 
- Run `composer install`;  
- Change the MySQL config in `config.php`;  
- Run `createtables.php` or import the dump in `dump.sql`;  
- Make sure `public_html/index.php` is reachable from you local web server;  
- Test away.
